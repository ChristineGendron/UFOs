# UFOs

## Overview

This repository contains code for a website the displays a table of data on 2010 UFO sightings. The table is filterable by date of sighting, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.

## Functionality

The page contains five input boxes, one for each possible search criteria. You can view the unfiltered data (the default), or you can type a search term into the applicable box. You can use as many or as few of the filter options as you'd like. See an example below:

## Proposals For Future Improvements

- One drawback of this webpage is the limited dataset. UFO sighting data is available for more recent years, and for decades in the past, but this site only captures one year. It would be helpful to add past data, and it would ideally be updated frequently as new data becomes available.

- It would be useful to have the ability to search using a date range rather than for one specific date at a time.

- Only lowercase letters are accepted in search terms. It would be more user-friendly if those fields were not case sensitive.
